## 🌟 About Me

Outside of coding, I’m all about music, movies, and the wonders of space. I’m a huge fan of orchestral film scores—especially the powerful work of Hans Zimmer and Thomas Bergersen. I love exploring sound creatively with the Roli Seaboard, a futuristic instrument that blends perfectly with my passion for cinematic music. Movies are another big part of my world—especially animations, sci-fi, and adventures that spark imagination and push boundaries. I'm endlessly fascinated by astronomy, galaxies, and anything that takes my mind beyond Earth. I also enjoy diving into cutting-edge tech and gadgets that push boundaries. 🌌
